1. Static factory method
========================

Advantages over constructors
----------------------------

* can have names
  * if constructors have many parameters, this can improve readabiilty of code
* don't have to return brand new object
  * useful for instance-controlled classes: singletons, immutable classes, non-instantiable classes etc
* can return object of subtype of declared return type
  * interface-based frameworks, return types are interfaces and the actual implementation is not public class
  * interfaces can't have static classes, by convetion the factory method for class Type is in class called Types
    * both previous bullets are used in Java Collections Framework: Array and Arrays, Collection and Collections
  * service provider framework pattern


Disadvantages
-------------

* no constructors means that class can't be subclassed
* more difficult to find in doc, unlike constructors, there is no special treating by javadoc
